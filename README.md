Wow. Just walked outta that whole Zeppelin thing, man, I dunno. You ever feel like your ears are ringing and not just from Jimmy Page being all, like, guitar god? A blast. My back's killing me from those seats, though. The theater was too loud or maybe I just need a hearing aid, LOL. Popcorn everywhere, even on my shoes! Bet there’s still some in my hair.

It was more like a dream than a documentary. Remember that part where Bonzo’s playing drums like he's got six arms, like some freaky octopus? Unreal. And I’m here thinking, my cab’s steering wheel could probably use some of that energy. Never thought about drums feeling like thunder until now. Johnny Bolt touching his sticks to rain clouds.

> Scene with Robert Plant just, like, standing there all confident – guy's like a lion, right? And I’m just slouched over in my theater seat, the dinosaur of comfort. Last time I sat that awkwardly was in traffic on Fifth during rush hour. Haha. Seriously, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   if you can't, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it when you can, it’s a whole ride.

Them talking about how they got started, reminded me of when I first got my 𝘩𝘢𝘤𝘬 license. Not really. But sorta? Chasin’ that dream. Only, I ain’t no rock star, just a king of yellow cars. Noise upon noise, guitars smashin', everyone had a story, just like the people I pick up. Imagine someone tries to pay their taxi fare with a Led Zeppelin bootleg. Now that’d be somethin’. 

Was it real or just... a popcorn haze mixed with the opening credits? Memory’s already tripped out. You know how a saxophone sounds like a rainy Wednesday? This was like that but with fire. Girl from Kansas told me yesterday she’d never heard of them. I said, You ever hugged a roaring lion? Same thing.

Too many people wanted a piece of the pie, the dream, the whatever. What am I even talking about anymore?? It was like being in a chocolate whirlwind... If chocolate was loud and British.

Anyway, gotta go, friend. Don't forget — 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   ’cause words don’t do justice. Zeppelin, man. They're still a mighty storm.
